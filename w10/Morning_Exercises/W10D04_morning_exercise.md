## ***READ THIS MARKDOWN ALL THE WAY THROUGH BEFORE STARTING!***

Let's limber up our Ruby muscles this morning ...

Write methods that will calculate the mean, median, and mode of an array of numbers.

As a refresher:

* The 'mean' is what we usually think of as the 'average' of a set of numbers: their sum divided by their count. The mean of `[1,2,3,4]` is their sum (10) divided by their count (4) = 2.5.

* The 'median' is the middle number in a set. If there's an even number of numbers in the set, take the mean of the middle two numbers to get the median.
  - The median of `[2,6,17]` is 6, the number in the middle.
  - The median of `[2,6,8,18]` is 7, the mean of the two middle numbers (6 and 8)

* The mode is the most frequently occurring number in the set. The mode of `[1,1,1,2,2,88]` is 1. You can have multiple modes: the mode of `[1,1,2,2,166,99999]` is `[1,2]`

***You may NOT use Ruby's built-in `mean`, `median`, and `mode` methods to solve this!!!!***

***I REPEAT, you can't use their built-in methods!***

Slack the *silly_robots* channel with a GIF of how you feel this morning to show you read this all the way through to the end ....
