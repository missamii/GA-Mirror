# Reread the lesson. As you go:
  # - Follow along with the creation of the User class in a .rb file & PRY
  # - Make yourself a cheatsheet of the ruby variable types we've learned so far: global, local, instance and class variables.
  # - Watch Shorty's videos 8a (6 mins) and 8b (8 mins) for some extra help.
