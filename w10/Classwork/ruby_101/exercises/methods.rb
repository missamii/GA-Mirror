# Ruby methods

# Exercises:
# ---------------------------------- #

# - Write a method called my_age that doesn't take any parameters that simply puts your age (hard coded).

# - Write a method called im_old that takes one parameter, your age, and `puts` your age * 2.

# - Change the above method to only `puts` "Your age is: " and use string interpolation to print out the user's age.

# - Change the above method again to simple `return` the user's age * 2.
