# - In yellow and underlined: "The soul which cannot endure fire and smoke won't find the Secret."

# - In cyan and italic: "Soul receives from soul that knowledge, therefore not by book nor from tongue. If knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart."

# - In light black and blinking: "If you do not possess the staff of caution and discrimination, use the eyes of him who sees. If there is no staff of caution and discrimination, do not wander on the road without a guide."
