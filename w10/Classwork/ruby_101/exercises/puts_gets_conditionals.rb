# Ruby conditionals and puts & gets

# Do these in a scratch '.rb' file & test them out in pry
# Use PUTS & GETS


# Exercises:
# ---------------------------------- #


# - Write a little program that asks the user what their name is. If their name is your name, puts "we have the same name!", otherwise puts "Your name is: <string interpolate their name here>"

puts "what is your name?"
is_user = get.chomp('tiffany')
if is_user >
  puts "your name is: #{name}"

gets ""

# - Write a little program that asks the user what week of WDI they're in. If they're below week 6, tell them they have a long way to go. If they're in week 6, tell them something encouraging. If they're over week 6, tell them they're almost there!
