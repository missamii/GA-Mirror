# Database Design Challenges â€“ Model Your Favorite Apps

## Introduction

As an extension of your practice earlier, it's time to challenge yourself to really analyze an existing application & try to understand the models & relationships behind it. Not every web application uses a SQL database, but it's a good skill to be able to design something similar.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Pick one or more of the following analyze what it primarily does & try to draw the tables & relationships:

  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
  - Instapaper
  - AirBnB
  - Tumblr

#### Deliverable

One or more ERD diagrams, using crows foot notation, of whatever app you choose.  For example:
