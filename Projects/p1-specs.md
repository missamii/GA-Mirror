#Project 1: games



#### Overview

Your first project will be something fun - a game!

You will be working **individually** for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

You have the week to build a **two-page** website. On each page will be a different game. Presentations will be Friday, July 1st at 10am.

The games can be anything you'd like - a real game like battleship - or a made up game.

#### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between two players
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

#### Necessary Deliverables

- **Two** working games, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A README file with:
  - An overview of the games you built
  - An explanation of how each game works and the technologies it relies on
  - Any unsolved problems
  - The URL to your hosted working game
  - [Here is an example](https://github.com/LizaLemons/ebay-node-search-frontend) of a README from a project I built earlier this year

#### Potential Project Ideas

**Blackjack**

Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

**Connect Four**

This is a board that accepts red or black tokens. Tokens fall down due to gravity, and lie in the first unoccupied space. Once four in a row are connected, a player wins!

**Self-scoring Trivia**

Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

#### Notes

- If you'd like to use third-party technology, like a CSS or JS plugin or library, talk with us first.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
