# INTRO TO PSEUDO-CODE

**A developer solves problems | A developer is a problem solver.**

**A developer embraces chaos | A developer makes order from chaos.**

**A developer turns noise into signal.**

Learning how to solve problems is fundamental to being a developer. In order to make interesting, creative, complex apps using a variety of technologies and techniques, having strong problem-solving skills is a must.

**Pseudo-coding** is all about breaking a problem down to its logical steps. As a developer, you can be faced with a 'wall of complexity' that will lead to paralysis; sometimes the most difficult part is knowing where to start. Taking some time just to think about, verbalize, or diagram a problem can give you all the clues you need to proceed. Often, it's a good idea to do this BEFORE you write any actual code.

Actually let me strike that -- ALWAYS, assuming the problem has sufficient complexity (and any problem complex enough to be interesting does!), it's better to think it through before banging out code. Pseudo-coding is a great way to do that.

The Arab mathematician Mohammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (the guy who invented algebra, and from whose name comes the word "algorithm") (fun fact: we named our last cohort after him!), summarized it best in his Golden Principle:

Pseudo-code is not Javascript or Ruby or C++ or the programming language of your choice. It is, however, written in *sequence*. It's the step-by-step thought process behind the code that you will eventually write. Write your pseudocode in short lines using basic grammar, as if an articulate ten-year-old is writing it. For example, here's some pseudo code for making lasagna:

> 1. Pre-heat oven to 350 deg F
> 2. Boil water for that crimpy pasta
> 3. etc . . .

Note that the pseudocode might differ in detail depending on the intended audience and author. For example, if I were going to pseudocode how to take the subway from my house to General Assembly, as an experienced subway rider, with an intended audience of other NYC residents, I might say:

> 1. Walk from my apartment to to B,C station at 96th St and CPW.
> 2. Take the next train to arrive. If it's a B train: take it to 34th St and transfer to the N,R. IF it's a C train: take it to 59th St, and transfer to the next B or D train and then transfer at 34th to the N,R.
> 3.

Open up a text editor and go ahead and pseudo-code the following problems. Try to see past any convoluted language or complexity to get to the core of it:

## EXERCISES
To be done in pairs

#### 1. RESTAURANT TIPPIN'

Mohammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, Syed Salahuddin, Liza Ramo, the Dalai Lama, and Ethan Friedman are getting dinner at a restaurant. Pseudo-code an application which can take the bill, split it amongst the five of them, and add a tip percentage of your choosing. For example a bill of $50 with a 20% tip should evaluate to $12 per person including tip.


#### 2. EQUATOR DRIVE

How much would it cost to drive around the world at the equator, assuming the Earth is rotating at 1000 mph, and assuming gas costs $3 per gallon, and your car gets 15 miles to the gallon.

#### 3. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE

Prime numbers play an important role in lots of applications. Maybe most relevant to WDI, prime numbers are the basis of modern cryptography. When you log on to your bank online, it's prime number-based cryptography that allows you to do so securely, without anyone being able to intercept your account information. Pseudocode how you might go about testing to see if a given number is prime.

e.g., given some number *n*, you want to determine if *n* is prime or not. As a refresher, a prime number is divisible only by itself and 1.
