#SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

###Let's review some of the concepts we covered this week.
Group assignments are below. Each numbered group should answer that respective numbered topic.

As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

We'll spend 5-10 minutes researching, and then each group will present their topic for 4-5 minutes, with questions, to the class. Each person in the group must speak at least once. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!


#####GROUP ASSIGNMENTS HERE

*(Each group answers the correspondingly numbered question.)*

1. Elena Peng, Harry Hur, Carlo Ruiz
2. Margaret Merrell, Babajide Kale, Samuel Duffy
3. Rikki Rabinowitz, Joseph Sul, Denis Koltsov
4. Austin Hudson, Cristina Ruiz, Tiffany Lo
5. Nathan Smith, Isaac Kang, Mimi Wu
6. Alberto Gomez, Kevin Bender, Aya Kawabata
7. Shreiya Chowdhary, Caspar Nagel, Daniel Yochum
8. Ivan Trujillo, Hiro Narita, Carrow Thibault  

#####Questions to Answer
1. Truthy and Falsey (in JavaScript): discuss, with examples. List the 'falsey' things. Why do we care? What do `&&`, `||`, and `!` do?
2. What is Git and Github? Why do we use it over other types of file-sharing? List and explain some basic git commands we use. Also discuss the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===` in JavaScript.
3. Preview of today: Why do we write functions? (What problems do functions solve?). Show us some syntax for a function - write out a function that will take an input number and double it and another function that will take an input string and log 'true' if the string is at most ten characters in length
4. What are the different types of loops in JS? Give an example of each (you do not need to show loop types we haven't yet gone over in class) and discuss when you might want to use each type. If you have nested loops where the outer loops counter runs from 0 to `x` and the inner loop counter runs from 0 to `y`, how many times in total will the inner loop run?
5. Array methods: what do push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), and .length do when called on an array? **Important**: when discussing methods, always make sure to focus in part on what they *return*....
6. More array methods: what do splice(), join() and slice() do? Give us an example! Let's also look at a few string methods: .split(), .toUpperCase(), .toLowerCase(), .toProperCase()
7. Objects! What is a JS object? How do we access its properties? What kinds of things can you put inside an object? Give an example of an object with different types of data contained inside. *Why* might you choose to use an object instead of an array to hold some data? What about the data would lead you to choose this data structure?
8. More methods! You want to built up a nice collection of methods you're familiar with. What do String.parseInt(), Number.toString(), Object.hasOwnProperty() and Object.keys() do? Remember to make clear what they *return*.
