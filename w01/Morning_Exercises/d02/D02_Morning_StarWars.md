## Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

After every Act, make sure you `git add -A` and `git commit -m "[YOUR MESSAGE HERE]"`!

If prompted by this assignment to create a file, give it a filetype of .txt

HINT - You should have your own cheatsheet you made last night, but [here is another cheatsheet that should help](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet)

HINT - An asterisk can act as a wildcard! If in unit1/d02/morning, what does ` ls r*.md `? Can you use the wildcard to combine a few similar moves together?

After every step, write down the commands in the appropriate section of ` starwars.md `.

## "A New Hope"
### Act I

* In your w01/classwork folder, create a directory called `star_wars`.

* In the `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`.

* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file. (Don't remember how to do this? Review last night's homework, the cheatsheet, or use the `other force`, known as Google!)

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a directory called `death_star`.

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`.

### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory.

* Create a file called `princess_leia` and add the text "Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope."

* Create a file called `obi_wan`.

* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`.

* Create a directory called `millennium_falcon`.

* Inside the `millennium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`.

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi_wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`.

* Move the `millennium_falcon` into the `death_star`.

### Act III

* Unload the Millennium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millennium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory.

* `darth_vader` has defeated `obi_wan`! Delete poor `obi_wan`.

* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the `millennium_falcon`! Remember: `darth_vader` remains in the `death_star` and `emperor_palpatine` is still in the `empire`.

* Move the `millennium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory.

* `darth_vader` leaves the `death_star` to pursue Luke! Move him from the `death_star` into the `empire` directory!

* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the `death_star`! Remove it from the galaxy! :boom:
