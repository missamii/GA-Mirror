Working with arrays

- Store a string of your first and last name (no space) in a variable called `myName`
- `split` the string into an array of characters, store this in an array called `myNameArr`
- `slice` the array into two variables - your first name (`firstName`) & your last name (`lastName`)
- Retrieve the character at index 3 in the `myNameArr` array & store it in a var called `third`
- Change the character at index 1 to be a 'T'
- At the end of `myNameArr` add the string "hello" (in a single index position)
- In a variable called `reverser`, reverse `myNameArr`
- Insert the numbers `7` & `4` (individually) to the beginning of `myNameArr`
