Working with objects

Create a `monkey` object, which has the following properties:
- `name` - string
- `species` - string  
- `foodsEaten` - array of strings
- `country` - string
- `age` - number

Create 3 monkeys total.

Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Complete each exercise using both syntaxes for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).

- Retrieve the first monkey's name and country & store in a var called `firstNameCountry`
- Change the second monkey's age to `135`
- Change the 3rd monkey's country to `France`
- Retrieve the array `foodsEaten` & store it in a variable called `foodsArr`
- Add to the end of the `foodsArr` array `cranberries` and `hamburger`
- Now add the same two to the end of `foodsEaten`
- Change all three monkeys' `species` to 'white faced saki monkey'
