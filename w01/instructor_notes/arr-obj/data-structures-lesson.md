- Compare adding and retrieving properties to an existing object using the dot and bracket notations
- Access properties of an object using keys and helper methods (.hasOwnProperty)
- Iterate over the keys of an object to return and manipulate values

Strings and numbers are not enough for most programming purposes. Most programming languages offer ways to group data into collections so we can use it more efficiently.

### Data structures in JS
- Arrays
- Objects


### Arrays
`var lizaArr = [1, 2, 8, 5];`

Arrays are great for:
- Storing data
- Enumerating data (do something to each piece of data one by one)

Arrays are similar in structure to a list. Each item in an array is called an `element`. Arrays can contain elements of different types, such as numbers, strings, etc.

#### Working with data in arrays
Items in arrays are stored in sequential order, just like a to-do list. The list begins at `0`. **Never forget that.**

How do we **create** arrays? There are several ways, but this is the most common way:

```JavaScript
// creates an empty array:
var friends = [];

// create a new array with values:
var friends = ['Rachael', 'Ross', 'Monica'];

```

How do we **access** arrays? Bracket notation using the index of the element.

```JavaScript

friends[0];
=> 'Rachael'

friends[1];
=> 'Ross'

friends[2];
=> 'Monica'

friends.length;
=> 3

var lastFriend = friends[friends.length - 1];
=> 'Monica'
```

#### A note about `.length` in JS
- This function tells you *one more than the highest index in the array.* This means that `array.length` isn't necessarily the number of items in the array. Think about the following:

```javascript
var a = ["dog", "cat", "hen"];
a[10] = "fox"; // this assigns 'fox' to the 10th index
a.length; // 11
```


#### How do we **add** and **delete** items from an array?

Push & Pop help us add/delete elements from the **end** of an array.

`.push()` adds an item to the end of the array, then `returns` the new length of the array.
`.pop()` removes the last item, and returns that item.

```javascript
friends.push('Chandler');
=> 4 // returns the new length of the arr

friends[3];
=> 'Chandler'

friends.pop();
=> 'Chandler'

```

Unshift & Shift help us add/delete elements from the **beginning** of an array.
```javascript

friends.unshift('Chandler');
=> 4 // adds one to the beginning & returns the new length of the array

friends[0];
=> 'Chandler'

friends.shift();
=> 'Chandler'

```

Removing specific items from an array:
```js
var friends = ['Rachael', 'Ross', 'Monica'];

// we want to remove 'Ross'
// first find the index of 'Ross'
friends.indexOf('Ross');
=> 1

// if we want to remove 'Ross' but keep an empty slot (not recommended)
delete friends[1]
=> true

friends
=> [ 'Rachael', , 'Monica' ]

// if we want to remove him altogether
friends.splice(1, 1)
=> [ 'Ross' ]

friends
[ 'Rachael', 'Monica' ]

// The second parameter of splice is the number of elements to remove.
// Note that splice modifies the array in place and returns a new array containing the elements that have been removed.

```



#### More array helper methods
`a.toString()` - Returns a string with the toString() of each element separated by commas.

`a.reverse()` - Reverse the array.

`a.join()` - take all the elements in an array and join them into a single string. Depending on what you pass join,
the string can be all one word, space separated, comma separated, etc.

*Note:* There are many more helper methods. You'll never memorize them all.

### Objects

Objects, just like arrays, store data for us. Unlike arrays, however, they elements are stored not in a lists with indices, but in *key-value pairs*.

```javascript

var myArray = ['Liza', 'Hayes', 'Ramo'];

var myObject = {
  firstName: 'Liza',
  middleName: 'Hayes',
  lastName: 'Ramo'
}

```

- Objects are nearly universal across programming languages, although they may have different names


#### Creating objects using object literal syntax

FYI: There are four ways to create objects:
- Object constructor using the keyword `new`
- Constructor function
- Object.create
- Object literal syntax

We are only going to look at the last one, **object literal syntax,** also called an object initializer. It looks like this:

`var myObject = {};`

Pretty simple, right?

We can also create an object with properties. In fact, we already did this above:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  firstName: 'Liza',
  middleName: 'Hayes',
  lastName: 'Ramo'
}
```


#### Object properties
- Each key on an object is called a `property`
- Think about this:

```js
var carObj = {
  engine: 'V6',
  seats: 4,
  wheels: 2
  convertible: false
}
```

**Note:** Aside from `null` and `undefined`, everything in JS is an object. More on that later...

**Keys** can either be a name, number or string.

**Values** can be anything - even arrays or objects.


#### Accessing values in an object
We access values by their key. To do so, we use `dot` or `bracket` notation.

```js
var carObj = {
  engine: 'V6',
  seats: 4,
  wheels: 2
  convertible: false
}

// get the type of engine

// dot notation
carObj.engine
=> 'V6'

// bracket notation
carObj['engine']
=> 'V6'

```

What if the object is very large and I want to check if it has a specific property? [`.hasOwnProperty()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)

This function returns T or F.

```js

var bigObj = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  four: 4,
  five: 5,
  six: 6,
  seven: 7,
  eight: 8
};

bigObj.hasOwnProperty('six');
=> true

// dot notation
bigObj.six
=> 6

// bracket notation
bigObj['six']
=> 6

```




### A tiny intro to nesting

Consider the following:

```js

var houseObj = {
  sqFeet: 3000,
  neighborhood: 'West Village',
  inhabitants: ['alana', 'olivia', 'liza']
}

// get inhabitants array:
houseObj.inhabitants
=> ['alana', 'olivia', 'liza']

// get just liza:
houseObj.inhabitants[2];

// get just liza & store her in a variable:
var liza = houseObj.inhabitants[2];


```

### More on nested arrays

Now that we've practiced the basics of arrays & objects, let's make things a little more complex.

```js
var arrayOfArrays = [
                      ['a', 'b', 'c'],  // 0
                      ['d', 'e', 'f'],  // 1
                      ['g', 'h', 'i']   // 2
                    ];
```

How do I access the first array?
`arrayOfArrays[0]`

The second array?
`arrayOfArrays[1]`

The 'e' in the second array?
`arrayOfArrays[1][1]`

### More on nested objects:

This is an array of objects:

```js
var objArr = [
	{  // 0
		color: "red",
		value: "#f00"
	},
	{  // 1
		color: "green",
		value: "#0f0"
	},
	{  // 2
		color: "blue",
		value: "#00f"
	},
	{  // 3
		color: "cyan",
		value: "#0ff"
	},
	{  // 4
		color: "magenta",
		value: "#f0f"
	},
	{  // 5
		color: "yellow",
		value: "#ff0"
	},
	{  // 6
		color: "black",
		value: "#000"
	}
]
```

How do I access the first object in the array?
`objArr[0]`

How do I access 'Red'?
`objArr[0].color`


Nested objects can be very large.

```js
{
	id: "0001",
	type: "donut",
	name: "Cake",
	ppu: 0.55,
	batters:
		{
			batter:
				[
					{ id: "1001", type: "Regular" },
					{ id: "1002", type: "Chocolate" },
					{ id: "1003", type: "Blueberry" },
					{ id: "1004", type: "Devil's Food" }
				]
		},
	topping:
		[
			{ id: "5001", type: "None" },
			{ id: "5002", type: "Glazed" },
			{ id: "5005", type: "Sugar" },
			{ id: "5007", type: "Powdered Sugar" },
			{ id: "5006", type: "Chocolate with Sprinkles" },
			{ id: "5003", type: "Chocolate" },
			{ id: "5004", type: "Maple" }
		]
}

  isFullTime : true,
  pastEmployers : ['Microsoft','Google','Amazon'],
