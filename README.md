# Student repo for WDI-NYC-53. (WDI Robots)

## Repo structure

This repo is organized as follows:
* Each week has its own directory (w1, w2, w3, etc.)
* With each week's directory, there are sub-directories for:
  * **Each topic** we're covering that week (e.g., JavaScript-101, Git, CLI, etc.). Inside each of those directories you'll find lesson notes, sample files or entire apps (when appropriate), and so on.
  * **Labs**: Instructions for the in-class labs for that week.
  * **Homework**: Instructions for that week's homework assignments.
  * **Morning_Exercises**: Instructions for that week's morning exercises
  * **Classwork**: ***THIS*** is where you should do all your work.


In addition to the Week directories, there are also directories (in the root folder of the repo) for:
  * **Projects**: Information for each of our four class projects will live here
  * **Cheatsheets_and_Resources**: Guides, cheatsheets, general resources will live here. For example, I've already created a guide to how to submit your homework that lives in this directory.

## Class structure

### Units

Our class is divided into four **units**, each of which will take anywhere from 2 - 4 weeks to complete. At the end of each unit is a project which you will complete and demonstrate to the class and your instructors.

Here's roughly what we'll cover in each unit (*subject to change depending on circumstances!)*

| Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Unit 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Javascript basics: datatypes, functions, etc. | APIs: what are they? | Backend vs. Frontend | Ruby |
| HTML / CSS | How the Web Works | Node.js | Ruby on Rails |
| Intermediate Javascript: intro to ES6, scope, factory & constructor functions, etc. | AJAX | Databases: MongoDB | Databases: PostgreSQL |

Topics may be shifted around between units as necessary.

## Class requirements

The ***FOREMOST*** predictor of success during and following this course is how much work you put into it. We have seen time and again that the most successful students are the ones who put in the most effort. Please don't be one of those students who thinks they can half-ass their way through this course. You can't. Liza and Ethan both took this class themselves -- please trust us when we say *you cannot slack your way through this course*!

That said, the following requirements are mandatory for graduation and consequent job search support.

1. **Attendance**: You must attend class. Each students is granted up to four absences. More than four absences will result in withdrawal from the class. The class will not stand still while you're not here! Given our incredibly compressed timeframe, missing a class can result in increased time and effort spent catching up. A late arrival (whether at the beginning of the day, returning from lunch, or returning from a break) counts as 1/4 of an absence. Late arrivals are disruptive to your classmates and the instructional team. ***Inform the instructional team*** via email or Slack (our contact info is below) if you're going to miss a class or be late.
1. **Homework**: You must complete 80% of the homework to graduate. We will alert you if you're falling below that threshold, but you can reach out to any one of us at any point if you're not sure. When your homework is graded, you'll be informed if you need to do additional work on it to have it count as a complete homework. We do *not* expect everyone to complete every homework! This class is ***hard***. Depending on the homework, getting most of the way through it may count as a completion. If a homework turns out to be too hard, don't freak out! Come find us. We'll work with you!
1. **Projects**: There are four projects, one at the end of each unit. Detailed project requirements will come later, and may change, but here's what we anticipate they'll look like:
  1. *Project 1 (solo project):* Build a web game.
  1. *Project 2 (solo project):* Build a web app that makes use of an external API to consume data.
  1. *Project 3 (group project):* Working in a (pre-assigned) group, build a full-stack web application with working backend (Node/Express) and frontend (using React) and persistent data storage in a database (MongoDB).
  1. *Project 4 (solo or group):* Working alone or in a pairing or group of your choice, build a full-stack web application, with working backend (Ruby on Rails) and frontend (using React) and persistent data storage (using PostgreSQL).
1. **Other**: This class is a group endeavor! Coming to class with a good attitude, working well with your classmates, and not being a negative distraction for the rest of the class are all essential.
