# all-day crud lab

### so for this lab we'd like you to create a location based app that uses these three services / apis. this should be pair programmed.

### geo-location https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition
  - first use the Geolocation capabilities of the browser to find where you / the client are.

### google maps api
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
  - now that you have that info use the Google Maps Javascript library to map your location.

### your own api!
  - lastly think of a cleaver way to use persistent data
  - it could be as simple as "check-in" feature.
  - should implement `post`, `get`, `update`, and `delete`

an example of a location based app would be:
https://foursquare.com/

### design
  - create repo!
  - first think of a MVP, what's the minimum required to show *something*.
  - think of your problems and identify them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_elicitation#Problems
  - write your requirements down and use github to track your progress by creating some github issues for them: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
