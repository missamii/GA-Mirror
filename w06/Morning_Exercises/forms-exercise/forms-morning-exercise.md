# W06D02 Morning Exercise:
Remember the OMDB API that you can use to get movie data? Of course you do! If you don't, the docs are [here](http://www.omdbapi.com/). Create a small form using any two elements *except a text input box* and make an API call based on user input. For example, you could have 3 `checkboxes` with 3 movie titles for the user to select, and a `dropdown` allowing them to choose `yes` or `no` if they'd like to see Tomato results with their query.

Find out how to get the value that the user selected depending on the form element you chose. When they hit Submit button make your API call using those query strings!
