# Week 8 down!

We're entering the homestretch ....

For your weekend you need to:

Build a simple CRUD app using

* Firebase for a backend

* React frontend

The topic is your choice!

**Read the Firebase docs before beginning!**

Your React frontend needs to hit up your Firebase backend to Create, Read, Update and Delete items from your database.

### BONUS
* Consume an external API to generate data, like we've done multiple times: Maybe you hit up the Colour Lovers API (remember that one!), but when the user saves a color, the data is stored in Firebase for retrieval later (if, say, the user wants to View all their favorite colors.)
