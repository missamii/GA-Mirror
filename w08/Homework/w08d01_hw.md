# Build a React calculator!

It should look, at least basically, like a calculator:

* Number keys 0 - 9
* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Divide and Enter (Equals) keys

It should work like a regular calculator: If I press 9, then 6, then 5, the display should show `965`. If I then press '+', 7, and Enter, the screeen should show `972` (result of 965 + 7).

No backend this time! Just build a React frontend.

### BONUSES (in no particular order)
- Build in support for memory (storing a number to recall later)
- Build in error-checking: I should not be able to, e.g., enter '9', '\*' and '+' -- the calculator should just do nothing when I hit the second operator key.
- Build in a decimal point to allow entry of non-integers
- Build in a 'repeat operation' ability: on a regular calculator, hitting the 'Enter' key repeatedly repeats the prior operation. So `965 + 7 = =` would result in 979 (965 + 7 two times).
