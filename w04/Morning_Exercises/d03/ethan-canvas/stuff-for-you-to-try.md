## Try to do the following:

1. Make the fireworks round instead of squares
1. Make the colors change randomly (like the velocity does)
1. Change the click "explosion" to an "implosion" (the fireworks collapse inwards instead of exploding outwards).
1. SUPER BONUS: make it 3D (I haven't done this!)
