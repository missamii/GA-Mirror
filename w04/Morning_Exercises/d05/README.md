## Now You See Me

Modal boxes are among the most effective design elements that a web designer can employ. A modal box is a scripted effect that allows you to overlay a small element over a website. The primary benefit of modal boxes it that they avoid the need to use of conventional window pop-ups or page reloads.

A few examples where a modal can be used:
* To collect data from users
* To provide additional information, i.e., instructions
* To hide lesser used features

Let's use this morning exercise to try implementing a modal! Here's what they look like:

The modal should also prevent the user from being able to use the app functionality while active - the modal is their priority when it's up!

## Setup

You've been provided a base `index.html` and `style.css`. Make edits in both as necessary. You'll likely need a JavaScript file (and potentially jQuery) linked as well.

Before coding, look at the requirements of the modal and try to correlate the features with anything we already know in either HTML, CSS, or JS. Spend 5-10 minutes planning out how to approach this with a partner and then tackle the code!

You may work in pairs -- provided your partner is not someone you've coded with this week.

## Completion

Get through the six core features of the modal during the exercise, and tackle the bonus if you're brave or want to revisit this later!

## Assignment

Here are the core features of the modal we're building:

* It does not appear on the page on load
* Clicking the existing button in the HTML makes the modal visible
* It is fixed and covers both the width and the height of the screen (do you remember vh?)
* The modal's background is black with an opacity between 0.4 and 0.8
* The modal contains a horizontally centered section with a non-black, fully opaque background
* The section contains a button that on click, will close the modal

If you get to that, here are some **bonus** features

* The modal smoothly transitions into and out of being
* The section animates into being as well
* Look up building your own animation using CSS! (animation-name, animation-duration, @keyframes). Use this to animate the section.
