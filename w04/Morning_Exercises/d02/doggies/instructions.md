# HTML + CSS Practice

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/p68Hk9u2hRSoM/giphy.gif)

This morning we are going to practice some more html and css by buiding that handsome, well-dressed dog a new website! Any business is good business!

## Set Up

PARTNER UP! Just like with pseudocoding, we should spend five minutes planning out our HTML and CSS.

You should WIREFRAME the webpage. Draw boxes around elements - it'll help you get a sense of which elements should be nested, where elements belong in the HTML, and what classes, etc. they should be given.

After five minutes, make a plan to figure out which elements you need!

Work in the starter `index.html` and `style.css` files in the doggies folder.

## Completion

Get as far as you can! You should definitely have a plan

## Assignment

You need to recreate the mockup shown here

![Dog-Mockup](./doggies/dog-mockup.png)

- What are the different aspects of this mockup? What are the largest elements/collections of elements you see?
- What elements appear to be nested within each other?
- Do any elements seem to have non-default styling?
- Is there anything in the starter code that might give you access to more style values?

NOTES:
- index.html and the dog-mockup.png file are in doggies/
- style.css is in doggies/stylesheets/
- image files are in doggies/assets/images/
- I've included a link in your html to grab the 'Cabin Sketch' font so you can use it in your css as needed.
