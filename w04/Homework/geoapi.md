#TalkxHale APP



### Concept Paper:
This is a Health APP. It's geared towards mental health. For ages 12 and up, male or female. This will easily help you find the available mental health therapist in the area. For FREE. It's as easy as finding a GYRO spot. :) This app was made out of my own time and effort. I wanted to volunteer myself to the community in the mental heath department. Everything used to create the APP, such as; Google places API and use of Documentation was all FREE! It took 3 days for me to create this. It should get a large amount of downloads as well, because mental health though not often talked about. Is something people do find themselves needing.


### Design Document:
This APP is called TalkxHale. It's a simple user friendly app, friendly in color with fresh looking font and UI. It will have a google styled location map. A search bar where you can search where you are looking for a mental health provider at. I will use an API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery(possibly) and the DOM to construct this.

Ideas of APP's that could use Geolocation
 // TalkxHale APP: This is an app that shows all the locations of therapist that are in the area to speak with you. When you need to speak with someone ASAP! Because mental health is important.
Resource for API: https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types

```


Back up ideas incase the first idea doesn't work well for me. :)
 // CoolPools: This is an app that shows all the locations of the pools in NYC.
 // EwFood: This app shows a location of all the restaurants that have unclean eating conditions.
