Concept Paper:

This is a Health APP. It's geared towards mental health. For ages 12 and up, male or female. This will easily help you find the available mental health therapist in the area. For FREE. It's as easy as finding a GYRO spot. :) This app was made out of my own time and effort. I wanted to volunteer myself to the community in the mental heath department. Everything used to create the APP, such as; Google places API and use of Documentation was all FREE! It took 3 days for me to create this. It should get a large amount of downloads as well, because mental health though not often talked about. Is something people do find themselves needing.
