#### Questions

1. What *is* React? What are the advantages of React? What are its limitations? Try to frame this versus plain JavaScript as opposed to in comparison with frameworks like Angular. What are a couple of the major add-on libraries for React?

2. Discuss `const` and `let` vs. `var`. What are the major differences? Which one of the three variable declarations are we going to (try to) stop using altogether? Does using `const` mean that the datatype the `const` points to is completely immutable? Or just the reference to it?

3. What is a JavaScript `class`? Whiteboard out an example. How does inheritance work with classes in JS? What is `constructor`? What is `super`?

4. Show us the two different ways of writing functions in JavaScript. Our old way, and the new one Syed just taught us. Aside from the shorter syntax, what a the key difference between them? How do we set the local environment (`this`) for a function to be what we wish?

5. What is the "single responsibility principle" in React? How does it affect how we design React components? What is JSX? Although JSX *looks* like HTML, it's not. What are some key differences we should keep in mind? What is the `key` attribute for HTML rendered via JSX and why do we need it?

6. What are React "props"? What is "state"? How do they move through the app? How do I mutate state? How do I hand off props between components?

7. Pick a (fairly) simple website. Project it up on the wall, and whiteboard out for us how you'd break it out into components. How would data flow between them? Where would you store it?
