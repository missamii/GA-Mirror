# REACTIVE UNICORNS!

Remember Liza's adorable My Little Unicorns CRUD app?

**You better remember it or she is going to cut you.**

I have deployed it! We now have a unicorns API that is live on the Interwebs at:

https://obscure-shelf-66446.herokuapp.com

woohoo!

You're going to start building a React frontend that will hit up this API.

Here are the API endpoints:

GET '/' -- just returns a message that it's a unicorns API
GET '/unicorns' -- returns a list of unicorns
GET '/unicorns/:name' -- returns that specific unicorn
POST '/unicorns/new' -- creates a new unicorn with properties from the request body
DELETE '/unicorns/:name' -- deletes that unicorn
PUT '/unicorns/:name' -- updates that unicorn

I want you to build a ReactJS-based frontend that hits up this API. For tonight I want you to get working:
1. displaying all the unicorns
2. displaying a specific unicorn by name

If you successfully complete that and want to try creating a new unicorn feel free!
