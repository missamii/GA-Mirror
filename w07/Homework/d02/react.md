##Part 2: React Questions

What is a component?
  + They are like small templates.


What is JSX?
  + A syntax used by React. JSX maps to real HTML elements when rendered.


What function do I use to create a component?
  + Createclass();


What does Webpack do?
  + Translates React's JSX syntax, etc. So that it can become readable to browsers.


What are props?
  + Immutable (let's react do fast reference checks).
  + They are used to pass data down from your view-controller(your top level component)
  +


What is state?
  + The heart of every React component is its “state”, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.


What's the one method every React component must have (hint: it rhymes with "bender") and what does it do?
  + render is a function that shows what's to be rendered to the DOM.
