# Rails 101 lab - tunr

You will be building a CRUD Rails API app for a record label company! yay.

Your app will have three entities - artists, records, and record company locations.

**BEGIN WITH THE ARTISTS AND COMPLETE THAT FIRST.** Then if you finish early do the other two.

Create your app from scratch. Make sure to include all 5 deadly routes (gluttony, pride, etc.) for each entity. Before you ever start coding, decide which URL you want your users to navigate to and what they will see once they are there. Also decide what attributes each entity has (records have a title, a releast date; locations have an address, tel num; artists have name, dob, etc.)

Remember, all but the Index route will need params. Your job is to create all the routes with params (where necessary) and use Postman to send data two different ways to your BE: using query strings and POST data.
