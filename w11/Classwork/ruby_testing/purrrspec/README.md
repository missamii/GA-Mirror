# PURRRRSPEC!

Let's test us some Cats.

1. Begin by examining Cat.rb. Read the code, then paste it into pry, create a new Cat and try out all the methods (multiple times in the case of some) until you understand how they work.
1. Now head over to `/spec/cat_spec.rb`. I've given you the skeleton of a RSpec test on our Cat class (notice the `require_relative ../cat` at the top of the file).
1. Your mission is to write tests for each of the methods on Cat:
  * new
  * is_asleep_at
  * rub_belly
  * is_better_than_dog
1. Your tests should confirm that each of these methods work as they're supposed to. Review the Cat class to figure this out and look at the comments in the test file (spec/cat_spec.rb).
1. Make sure your solution is purrrrrrrfect!
