# omg the final homework

Build a Rails API backend w/ SQL database to track your record collection.

We'll call it TUNR.

You must have tables in your database for

* Artists
* Songs
* Albums

Each album of course has many songs, each artist has many albums, each song belongs to one artist and one album (or many albums, I suppose), each album has one artist (to keep it simple).

Artists should have first_name, last_name (required), instruments_played, whatever else you want to track.

Songs should have title (required), genre, and of course the ids for the corresponding artist and album (both required), and whatever else you want to track (running time, I don't know)

Albums should have title (required), genre, the id for the artist whose album it is (required), whatever else you want to track.


ROUTES
* `GET /albums` returns a list of all albums
  - if you get all the basic routes working: try to make sure that the data the API returns for this route doesn't just include album IDs, but includes the actual titles of those albums
* `GET /artists` returns a list of all the artists
* `GET /songs` returns a list of all the songs
  - if you get the basic routes working: make sure that instead of just displaying artist and album IDs, the data the API returns includes the name of the artist who performs each song and the name of the album it's on
* `GET /songs/:title` returns that song
  - same note as above
* `GET /albums/:title` returns that album
  - same note as above
* `GET /artists/:name` returns that artist
* `POST /artists/new` creates a new artist
* `POST /albums/new` creates a new album
* `POST /songs/new` creates a new song
* `PUT /artists/:id` edits artist
* `PUT /albums/:id` edits album
* `PUT /songs/:id` edits song
* `DELETE /artists/:id`, `DELETE /songs/:id`, `DELETE /albums/:id` deletes appropriate entity

BONUSES
- include routes to get all songs by a given artist, all albums by a given artist, all songs on a given album
