# Building a super-simple Rails app

Below you'll find an object that simulates the result of hitting up a database for some book info. You're building a Rails backend. Some other development team's React/JS front end will make AJAX calls to the backend to get JSON.

The routes you and the front-end team have agreed on are
  * `GET /books`: will send an array of all the books
  * `GET /books/:id` will fetch a book by id
  * `GET /books/by-title/:title` will send the book with that title.
  * `GET /books/by-author/:author` will send the book by that author
  * `GET /books/by-genre/:genre` will send all books of that genre
  * `GET /books/by-year-of-publication/:year` will send all books published in the given year
  * `GET /books/by-publisher/:publisher` will send all books published by a given publishing house
  * `POST /books/new` will add a new book to your array of sample data (see below)
  * `DELETE /books/:id` will delete that book
  * `PUT /books/:id` will update that book

Your task: Build a new Rails API server that will make it happen! For now, you can use the sample data below (or create your own).  Create at least three new books, edit a couple, delete a book (NOT MINE, or you fail the course). Use Postman or the equivalent to simulate your front-end.
