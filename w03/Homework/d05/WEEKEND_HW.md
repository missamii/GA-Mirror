# CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST PROJECT!

Take a day or two, relax and enjoy!

Then: here's what you need to do over the holiday weekend.

1. Try to finish any incomplete homeworks. Reach out to the instructors if you're not sure which homeworks are incomplete. Reminder: 80% of the homeworks must be complete in order to graduate.

1. Bone up on any topics you think you're shaky on. Nested loops still make your brain break? Write a bunch! Watch videos on loops. And so on.

1. VIDEOS! Please make sure you've watched the following videos from Shorty's playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1xVKFbouelUj3g_56CRAUjGGEU13bPF):
  - 108. JavaScript - Constructor Functions
  - 109. JavaScript - Prototypes
  - 110. JavaScript - Closures
  - 100. JavaScript - setInterval
  - 101. JavaScript - setTimeout
  - 102. JavaScript - bind


  In addition, I would try to keep working your way through Matt Huntington's videos on HTML/CSS [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J). Make sure you watch the videos on HTML forms, CSS floats and selectors, CSS pseudo selectors, fonts, transform, and transition. And if you want a flexbox review, watch the flexbox videos.

**OPTIONAL**: if you want to learn more about jQuery, watch the following from Shorty's list:
  - 103. jQuery - Using jQuery
  - 104. jQuery - Grabbing and Manipulating the DOM
  - 105. jQuery - Creating and Adding New Elements
  - 106. jQuery - Animations
  - 107. jQuery - Events
