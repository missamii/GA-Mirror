# CLASS SQUADS

## What are Squads?
Our cohort is divided up into three squads. Each squad will work closely with one of the instructional team at a time on homework (by the end of the course, each squad will have worked with each instructor). The squad's instructor will grade the squad's homework, and we'll probably also set up a squad lunch at some point!

## Squad Rotation
Each squad will rotate between the instructors so that all three members of the instructional team will have graded all the students by the end of the course.

Here's the rotational schedule:

| | Squad I | Squad II | Squad III |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit 1** | Liza Ramo | Ethan Friedman | Syed Salahuddin |
| **Unit 2** | Ethan Friedman | Syed Salahuddin | Liza Ramo |
| **Unit 3** | Syed Salahuddin | Liza Ramo | Ethan Friedman |
| **Unit 4** | Liza Ramo | Ethan Friedman | Syed Salahuddin |
