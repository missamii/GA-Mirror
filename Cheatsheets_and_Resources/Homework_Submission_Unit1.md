### HOMEWORK SUBMISSION VIA GITHUB ISSUES

In order to submit homework, you must have:
1. Forked the class repo (found [here](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-nyc-robots)) on Github to your personal Github.
1. Cloned that remote repo from your Github to your local machine. If you haven't yet, do this now!
1. Committed and pushed your changes. In the Terminal, in the directory where you're working (generally that day's directory):
```
git add -A
git commit -m "some sort of commit message, i.e., 'working on homework. Ethan sucks'"
```

This saves the changes to your local repo on your machine. You now need to push those changes out to your remote repo on Github: `git push origin master`
1. When you've completed the homework (or gotten as far as you're going to), go to your Github account and navigate to the folder where the homework (the URL will look something like https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/wdi-nyc-robots/tree/master/Week_1/Homework). Copy this URL to the clipboard. NOTE that we can see your commit history -- we want to see regular, frequent commits while you're working on the homework? Got one part done? Then commit it!
1. Now go to our main class repo (again, [here it is](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-nyc-robots)). *(TIP: bookmark both the class repo and your personal fork -- you'll be accessing them both constantly.)* Click on the 'Issues' tab and create a new Github Issue:

  * Title: [Your name] Homework Week#Day# (e.g., Ethan Friedman HW W01D04)
  * Body: In the body of the issue, paste the link to the homework's location, the one you just copied.

  Include also, on a scale of 1-5:
  * How complete you feel your HW submission is
  * How comfortable you felt with the HW

  Also include:
  * Wins: What are you feeling good about in the topics covered in the HW?
  * Struggles: What are you struggling with?
  * Comments: Anything else you'd like to add? When you're done, submit the issue. Your homework is in! **NOW GO TO SLEEP**
