# MONGO, MONGO, EVERYWHERE!

## With Bonus Unicorns

### Part 1: MON-GOD!

Tonight's homework is practice with MongoDB. We're going to do everything in the terminal. Part 1 is mandatory. Part 2 is optional if you get through Part 1 with time to spare.

Make sure you've got `mongod` running in a terminal window. In another, just type `mongo`. This opens up a connection to our database server right from our terminal! (If you check out the `mongod` tab you'll see it should say "1 connection now open".)

This exercise comes from the [Little Book of MongoDB](http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf), an awesome resource for learning to use MongoDB. Read through Page 30.

Create a new database and use it: use <dbname of your choice here>

E.g., `use thursdayHW` would create a new database named `thursdayHW` and switch to it.

Now make a new collection!

Go to pp. 14 and 15 of The Little Book of MongoDB at the link above.. Copy all the "unicorns" data and paste it into your terminal. ( I think Syed gave you unicorn data in class; you can get this data from the file he created as well.)

Refer to the book if you're stuck!

You should get a message that a whole bunch (herd? sparkle? horn? rainbow? what's the collective noun for unicorns?) of unicorns were inserted.

In your terminal, write the mongo commands to answer the following questions. Paste your answers here:

  * Get all of the unicorns
  >

  * Get all of the female unicorns
  > db.unicorns.find({gender})

  * Get all of the unicorns who like grape
  * Get all of the female unicorns who like apples
  * Get all of the female unicorns who like apples OR carrots OR strawberry
  * Get all of the unicorns who weigh more than 550 pounds AND like watermelon
  * Get all of the unicorns born before the year 2000.
  * Get all of the unicorns who don't have a vampires field
  * Get all of the male unicorns who have killed more than 25 vampires. (The "vampires" field represents the number of vampires slain by that unicorn.)
  * Make a new unicorn with name "Syed", born on January 7, 1654, loves JavaScript, teaching, and Smurfs, weighs 140 pounds, and has killed 1,523 vampires.
  * Make a new collection called vampires
  * Add a new document to your vampires collection named "Liza". She was killed (or reborn as undead if you prefer) on Oct 7, 1865, loves blood, killing, and mayhem, has eaten 154 unicorns, is female, and owns dope headphones, a MacBook, and a water bag.
  * Create another vampire: Shorty. He was killed on Jan 1, 1125; he loves being silly; he has eaten 1,550,054 unicorns. His current_location is Google, Inc.
  * Oh no! Syed has slain Liza. Change his vampires property to reflect one more vampire killed. Also, delete Liza from the vampires collection.
  * There's been a total change of taste in the unicorn population. Everyone who like carrots has simultaneously decided they're disgusting. Remove carrots from their 'likes' field.
  * Every unicorn has decided they like watermelon (it's summer!). Add it to everyone's likes array.
  * Shorty strikes again. He's got 3 unicorns working as secret agents for the evil vampires. Give Shorty a 'unicornSpies' property, which is an array of three unicorns' ObjectIDs.

### Part 2: Babbl-ing

Think about how you might rework your Babblr server code to hit up your MongoDB instead of your babbls.json file.

Start by creating a babblr database in Mongo, and a babbls collection within it.

Insert 3 - 4 babbls into the collection as seed data.

We don't necessarily expect you to rework your server code tonight to use Mongo -- but think about what you'd need to do, and answer below:

  * what would you need to add to your backend server JS file?
  * How would you rework your GET and POST route callback functions now that you're no longer hitting up babbls.json?
  * How would you layer in:
    - GET route to get all babbls by a given author?
    - PUT route to edit a specific babbl?
    - DELETE route to delete a specific babbl?
  * For those three new routes, on the front end, how might you modify your web page so that you can perform those tasks? (i.e., viewing all of author X's babbls, editing a given babbl, or deleting a given babbl)?
