SLIPPIN' THROUGH THE WEEK

Let's review some of the concepts we covered this week.

Group assignments are below. Each numbered group should answer that respective numbered topic.

As a programmer, you'll be responsible for knowing your code AND defending your code to the head honchos. Let's get comfortable explaining code to each other!

We'll spend 10-15 minutes researching, and then each group will present their topic for 4-5 minutes, with questions, to the class. Each person in the group must speak at least once. Don't worry about being incorrect - we'll help nudge you in the right direction!
