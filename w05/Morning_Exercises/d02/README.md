# Gradi-mations

Let's step away from Node and npm and Javascript and all that silly nonsense. This morning, we're going to research custom CSS animations AND gradients! These are little tricks that can make a website look super cool, or super 90's if done the wrong way (or right way if you're into that).

After this exercise, you should have some confidence that you were able to design a page with some cool effects using only what you researched! We're teaching you how to learn programming, so it shouldn't come as a shock to you that you're able to pick some tricks up on your own.

## Setup

A starter `index.html` and `style.css` set of linked files have been provided. Do your work in the CSS, but feel free to edit the HTML as necessary.

Work with a partner! If you read this line of code, send Ethan a direct message on slack that "I read this readme!".

## Assignment

#### Step 1 - Partner Up

#### Step 2 - Split Tasks

Spend up to 10 minutes researching:
* One partner research CSS animations - [**CSS keyframes**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes)
 - What CSS properties would a keyframe be called on?
 - What additional parameters can those properties take?
* One partner research [**CSS gradients**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients)
 - What properties can a gradient be a value for?

#### Step 3 - Build Out Simple CSS

Spend up to 10 minutes implementing your research:
* Each partner should change the **body's** CSS in their own files to reflect what they researched
* [These colors](http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/) may be useful

#### Step 4 - Combine Worlds

Spend up to 10 minutes working with your partner:
* Walk your partner through what you researched
* Try to combine a gradient and an animation on the body element
* Does this work as you predicted?
* Does it work at all?
* Use other elements on the page so that you can have at least one gradient and at least one keyframe animation on the page

#### Step 5 - 5 Minute Gallery / Science Fair
