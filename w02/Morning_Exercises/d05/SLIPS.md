### Questions

1. What is the "DOM"? (HINT: It is not an S&M reference!)

2. Name three ways we can **get** elements from the DOM if we want to manipulate them in JavaScript.

3. What are the basic components of an HTML page? What do they do?

4. Fun with HTML tags! What are the following tags intended for:
  * \<header\> (and \<footer\>)
  * \<div\>
  * \<p\>
  * \<img\> (also: what key attribute does this tag need?)
  * \<a\> (also: what key attribute does this tag need?)
  * \<ul\>
  * \<ol\>
  * \<li\>
  * \<nav\>

5. CSS: Order of Priority: In-line styles vs. CSS styles selecting via an ID, a class, or a tag type. Which ones have priority over which other ones? In the event of a tie (two styles applied via the same method), which one will win out?

6. What is a "callback" function? Show us one. What do they let us do?

7. How do we "listen" for something to occur on a given HTML element? What are some of the things we can listen for?

8. How do we create a new HTML element? How about a text element? How do we add them to the DOM?
