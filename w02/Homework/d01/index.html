      <h1>WHO I AM</h1>
        <p>
          My life has been a hectic one since as far back as I can remember. I think the craziness as made me the best person I can be today. I was born in Mineloa, NY. At the age of 3 my family and I moved to Ocala, FL. So I've spent many years on the beach. I was what they called a beach bum. Throughtout my time living in Florida, we lived in Daytona Beach and Palm Coast. Eventually, I ended up in New York.

          It has been a huge uphill battle living in The City on my own at 18. Somethings I do regret, while others not so much. Fortunatly, it was able to teach me a whole lot. I was able to grow more then I ever could have living with my family. Finally, I saw the world for how it was, how it could be. From the beautiful sunets and buildings that could make your trouble in awe. To the more wickest hearts of people, and the lowest saddest conditions.

          I would like to say that these things really made me out to be a decent person. Thankfully, I have grown up a lot in the past 9 years of trecking out here in this concrete jungle. I went from hating loving Graphic Design and Coding to hating it to loving it all over again. People no longer walk all over me anymore. I stand up for myself, the people I care about and simple the injustice I see done to people I may not ever get to know. I see myself as an activist. Though still very introverted. Now my story no longer owns me. But now I own my story. As the author, let my tell you. I am particpating in the most amazing Coding Bootcamp right now. In my younger years, I could never imagine this would be possible. And let me tell you this, I play to do great things!
