      <h1>WHO I AM</h1>
        <p>
          My life has been a hectic one since as far back as I can remember. I think the craziness as made me the best person I can be today. I was born in <b>Mineloa, NY</b>. At the age of 3 my family and I moved to <b>Ocala, FL</b>. So I've spent many years on the beach. I was what they called a beach bum. Throughtout my time living in Florida, we lived in <b>Daytona Beach</b> and <b>Palm Coast</b>. Eventually, I ended up in New York.

          It has been a huge uphill battle living in The City on my own at 18. Somethings I do regret, while others not so much. Fortunatly, it was able to teach me a whole lot. I was able to grow more then I ever could have living with my family. Finally, I saw the world for how it was, how it could be. From the beautiful sunets and buildings that could make your trouble in <i>awe</i>. To the more wickest hearts of people, and the lowest saddest conditions.

          I would like to say that these things really made me out to be a decent person. Thankfully, I have grown up a lot in the past 9 years of trecking out here in this concrete jungle. I went from hating loving Graphic Design and Coding to hating it to loving it all over again. People no longer walk all over me anymore. I stand up for myself, the people I care about and simple the injustice I see done to people I may not ever get to know. I see myself as an activist. Though still very introverted. Now my story no longer owns me. But now I own my story. As the author, let my tell you. I am particpating in the most amazing Coding Bootcamp right now. In my younger years, I could never imagine this would be possible. And let me tell you this, I play to do great things!
